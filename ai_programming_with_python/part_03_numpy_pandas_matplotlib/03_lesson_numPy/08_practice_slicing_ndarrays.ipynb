    "As we mentioned earlier, in addition to being able to access individual elements one at a time, NumPy provides a way to access subsets of ndarrays. This is known as slicing. Slicing is performed by combining indices with the colon : symbol inside the square brackets. In general you will come across three types of slicing:\n",

    "1. ndarray\\[start:end\\]\n",
    "2. ndarray\\[start:\\]\n",
    "3. ndarray\\[:end\\]\n",
    "The first method is used to select elements between the start and end indices. The second method is used to select all elements from the start index till the last index. The third method is used to select all elements from the first index till the end index. We should note that in methods one and three, the end index is excluded. We should also note that since ndarrays can be multidimensional, when doing slicing you usually have to specify a slice for each dimension of the array.\n",
